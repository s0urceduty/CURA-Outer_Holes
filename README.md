The concept behind the Swiss Cheese Angled Hole Modifier Python program is to introduce a novel method for integrating complex ventilation, structural, or aesthetic patterns into 3D prints. This script simulates deep, diagonal cylindrical holes — resembling the signature irregular cuts found in Swiss cheese — by removing extrusion commands along randomly generated angled paths through the G-code of a sliced model. These virtual "drill paths" are calculated to cut entirely through the model, traversing across layers and material volumes to simulate realistic tunnels or ventilation shafts. By leveraging random XY vectors and geometric distance checks, the program ensures that each selected toolpath reflects a real physical perforation. This kind of post-processing is especially valuable when aiming to lighten prints, improve airflow, or enhance the visual complexity of models without revisiting CAD design.
